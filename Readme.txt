TASK1: A C program that determines if the matrix is square or not and if its square it gives the sum of the each row and each column. It also calculates the sum of diagonal elements of square matrix (two dimensional arrays) and also find the transpose of given square matrix. This program takes input of values of square matrix from user and gives the output.

TASK2: A C program that pass the array (length = 20) and check that array is symmetric or not using pointer. Take input from user.

TASK3: A C program that pass the arguments to a function using pointers to calculate the distance between two points on the Cartesian grid. Take input from user.
